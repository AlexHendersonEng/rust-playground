/*
    This project was generated using Cargo which is Rust's build system and package manager.

    Using 'cargo new' generates a project directory with a 'src' directory and a 'Cargo.toml'
    file which is a configuration file that describes how to build the project.

    When building a project using 'cargo build' a Cargo.lock file is generated which keeps
    track of the exact versions of dependencies in the project.

    Using 'cargo run' will build and run the project.

    Using 'cargo check' will check the project for errors but will not generate an executable.
